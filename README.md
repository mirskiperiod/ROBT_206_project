# ROBT_206_project
This is my project which shows 2 step gate security system. It focuses on arduino.
The process looks like this: car comes and presses one button on remote control, that signal is received by IR receiver, then opens first gate. After he passes through first gate, he should touch the touch screen in order to open the second gate. Basically that is it.
